    install.packages(c(
      "tidyverse", "nycflights13", "shiny", "here", "xaringan", "rticles", "conflicted"
    ))
    ```

## Cloud instance

If you can't install RStudio on your local machine, or experience problems, you can always use the rstudio.cloud instance.

1. Navigate to https://rstudio.cloud/project/271256

    This requires signing up, you can also sign in with a GitHub or Google account.

2. After signing in, there will be a button "Save a Permanent Copy" on the toolbar (between the red TEMPORARY sign and the gear). Click it to make sure your changes aren't lost.
