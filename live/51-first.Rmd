# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

1. One

2. Two

3. Three

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r echo = FALSE}
# Comment
```


```{r flights}
flights_per_month %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(month), y = n)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(
    x = "Month",
    y = "Number of flights",
    title = "Flights per month",
    subtitle = "Across all airlines"
  )
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
