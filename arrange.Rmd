```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
```


## Flight with shortest airtime

```{r}
flights %>% 
  arrange(...) %>%
  head(...)
```


## Flight with heaviest delay

```{r}
flights %>% 
  arrange(...) %>%
  tail(...)
```

Why doesn't this give the result we're looking for? Can we use a filter? Or the pattern below?

```{r}
flights %>% 
  arrange(..., ...) %>%
  tail(...)
```


# Flight with longest airtime



# UA flights with lowest delay

```{r}
flights %>% 
  ...(...) %>% 
  ...(...)
```


```{r}
flights %>% 
  ...(...) %>% 
  ...(...)
```


# Recovering delay

```{r}
flights %>% 
  arrange(...)
```
