## Map to the color aesthetic

Simply insert `color = <var>` in the `aes()` call, where `<var>` is a variable in the `mpg` dataset:

```{r echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = cyl))
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = trans))
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = drv))
```

Looks like the cars with large displacement are two-seaters with rear drivetrain.
