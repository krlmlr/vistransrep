# Introduction

The `tidyverse` has quickly developed over the last years.
Its first implementation as a collection of partly older packages was in the second half of 2016.
All its packages "share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures."^[citation from [tidyverse homepage](https://www.tidyverse.org/)]
It is for sure difficult to tell, if "learning the `tidyverse`" is a hard task, since the result of this assessment might differ from person to person.
We do believe though, that there are concepts in its approach, which -- when grasped -- have the potential to increase one's productivity, since code creation will seem more natural.
While this might be true for all languages (once you speak it well enough, things go smoothly), in our opinion the `tidyverse` worth exploring in depth, since it is

1. consistent: an especially well designed framework that aims at making data analysis and programming intuitive,
2. evolving: constantly deepened understanding for challenges arising in modern data analysis leads to improving ergonomic user interfaces.

## Overview

This course covers several topics, which everyone working more intently with the `tidyverse` almost inevitably needs to deal with at some point or another.
The topics are organized in chapters that contain mostly R code with output and text.
In each section, exercises are provided.
