"Two variable plots" can be split into sub-categories:

- Continuous X and Y

- Continuous X and discrete Y (and vice-versa)

- Discrete X and Y

### Continuous X and Y

```{r include = FALSE}
# Continuous X and Y
```
```{r 13-continuous-x-and-y}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = cty, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point()
```

---

### Discrete X and continuous Y

```{r include = FALSE}
# Discrete X and continuous Y
```
```{r 13-discrete-x-and-continuous-y}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

---

### Discrete X and Y

```{r include = FALSE}
# Discrete X and Y
```
```{r 13-discrete-x-and-y}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class, y = manufacturer)) +
  geom_jitter()
```
