The RStudio IDE offers a convenient way to import files in various common formats, including CSV and Excel.
The "File / Import Dataset / From ..." menus provide access to import assistants that:

1. open a file for preview,
1. allow tweaking import options,
1. generate R code that you can copy-paste into your scripts for further reuse.

The assistant is run once for each dataset, from then only the generated code is required to import the data in a consistent way.

This is an example of auto-generated code for importing a dataset from the `data/` directory.

```{r include = FALSE}
# Import one single file
```
```{r 31-import-one-single-file}
example1 <-
  read_delim(
    "data/example1.csv",
    ";",
    escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE
  )
```

After importing, use `view()` to display the ingested dataset.

```{r include = FALSE}
# View the result
```
```{r 31-view-the-result}
view(example1)
```
