### Pivoting

```
```{r 401-setup-401-pivot-r}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)

library(conflicted)
conflict_prefer("filter", "dplyr")
conflict_prefer("lag", "dplyr")
```
</details>

Pivoting describes operations that help rearrange data in different ways.
The following two tables contain the same data arranged differently.

```{r include = FALSE}
# Two datasets containing the same data, wider and longer:
```
```{r 401-two-datasets-containing-the-same-data-wider-and-longer}
table1
table2
```

Both tables contain `country` and `year` column that describe the source of the measurements.
The "wider" version, `table1`, contains two columns that hold the number of cases (of a disease) and the population for the corresponding country in the corresponding year.
In the "longer" version, `table2`, the number of cases and the population are stored in the same `count` column, with the `type` column defining the measurement.

Somewhat counter-intuitively, "longer-form" data is often better suited for analyzing data.
"Wider-form" data makes better use of screen space, but may be more difficult to work with.

The following example computes the maximum number of cases and population for each country.
For the wider form, this requires repeating the same expression for all columns.
This may work with two columns but becomes tedious once more measurements are added.

```{r include = FALSE}
# How to summarize?
```
```{r 401-how-to-summarize}
table1 %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(
    max_cases = max(cases),
    max_population = max(population)
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
```

The `_at` family of functions helps iterating over columns, but all columns still need to be enumerated.
(Specifying ranges of columns is rather brittle.)

```{r include = FALSE}
# Iterate over columns:
```
```{r 401-iterate-over-columns}
table1 %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize_at(
    vars(cases, population),
    max
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
```

If the data is in the "longer" form, it is sufficient to include `type` in the grouping variables.
The same code works for arbitrary number of measurements.

```{r include = FALSE}
# In the longer form, this becomes a grouped operation:
```
```{r 401-in-the-longer-form-this-becomes-a-grouped-operation}
table2 %>%
  group_by(country, type) %>%
  summarize(
    max = max(count)
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
```

The following examples give a gentle introduction into pivoting.

### Convert to longer form

The `pivot_longer()` function takes a "wider-form" dataset and converts it to an equivalent dataset with more rows.

```{r include = FALSE}
# Converting to longer form: pivot_longer()
```
```{r 401-converting-to-longer-form-pivot-longer}
table1

table1 %>%
  pivot_longer(-c(country, year))
```

The `-c(...)` notation indicates that all column except `country` and `year` are to be transformed into longer form.
The column names become the contents of the new `name` column, the values are available in the `value` column.

**Your turn**: The result of this operation isn't strictly equivalent to `table2`.
What is missing?

Alternatively, the `names_to` and `values_to` arguments allow specifying the names of the new columns.

```{r include = FALSE}
# Your turn: How to rename and arrange to create `table1`?
```
```{r 401-your-turn-how-to-rename-and-arrange-to-create-table-1}
try(
  table1 %>%
    pivot_longer(-c(country, year)) %>%
    select(....., everything())
)

table1 %>%
  pivot_longer(
    -c(country, year),
    names_to = "type",
    values_to = "count"
  )
```

### Convert to wider form

The `pivot_wider()` form does the inverse: it creates a dataset with fewer rows.
If the `name` and `value` columns are named differently, these columns can be provided via the `names_from` and `values_from` arguments.

```{r include = FALSE}
# Converting to wider form: pivot_wider()
```
```{r 401-converting-to-wider-form-pivot-wider}
table2

table2 %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = type, values_from = count)
```

**Your turn**: `pivot_wider()` expects columns `name` and `value` by default.
What do we need to do to get rid of `names_from` and `values_from`?


```{r include = FALSE}
# Your turn:
# pivot_wider() expects columns `name` and `value` by default.
# How to transform so that we don't need `names_from` and `values_from`?
```
```{r 401-your-turn}
try(
  table2 %>%
    select(......, everything()) %>%
    pivot_wider()
)
```


### Use cases

Data in "longer" form usually works better for plotting the values side by side, e.g. by assigning the type of value to an aesthetic.
Recall that each row in the data produces one geometric object in the corresponding layer.
For a bar chart that shows cases and population side by side, mapped to the `y` aesthetic, the "longer" form is more natural.

- `table2` form requires only one layer, the fill color is determined automatically, the legend is created automatically
- `table1` requires two layers, manual assignment of fill color, and manual creation of legend (not shown)

```{r include = FALSE}
# Longer form: more useful for plotting all values side by side
```
```{r 401-longer-form-more-useful-for-plotting-all-values-side-by-side}
table2 %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(country, count, fill = type), position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~year) +
  scale_y_log10()

table1 %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(country, population), position = "dodge", fill = "blue") +
  geom_col(aes(country, cases), position = "dodge", fill = "red") +
  facet_wrap(~year) +
  scale_y_log10()
```

On the other hand, iIf only a single measurement needs to be plotted, the "wider" form is easier to work with.

- `table1` only requires selecting the correct column
- `table2` requires a `filter()`

```{r include = FALSE}
# Wider form: more useful for plotting a single value
```
```{r 401-wider-form-more-useful-for-plotting-a-single-value}
table1 %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(country, cases)) +
  facet_wrap(~year)

table2 %>%
  filter(type == "cases") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(country, count)) +
  facet_wrap(~year)
```

The "wider" form is also the only way to map different measures to different aesthetics, e.g. to correlate values.

```{r include = FALSE}
# Wider form: the only way to correlate values
```
```{r 401-wider-form-the-only-way-to-correlate-values}
table1 %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(cases, population, color = factor(year), shape = country)) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10()
```


### Combining vertically

A different view on the same data is given in the two tables `table4a` and `table4b`.

```{r include = FALSE}
# Split data
```
```{r 401-split-data}
table4a
table4b
```

The `bind_rows()` function combines these two parts into a single table.
The `.id = "type"` setting ensures that the input datasets gain different tags in the new `type` column.


```{r include = FALSE}
# Combine
```
```{r 401-combine}
table4 <-
  bind_rows(
    cases = table4a,
    population = table4b,
    .id = "type"
  )
table4
```

**Your turn**: As before, `pivot_longer()` helps converting the results into something similar to `table2`.
The result isn't quite the same yet, can you spot the difference?

```{r include = FALSE}
# Your turn: The results aren't quite the same as those of `table2` yet,
# what is missing?
```
```{r 401-your-turn-the-results-aren-t-quite-the-same-as-those-of-table-2-yet}
try(
  table4 %>%
    ...(c(.....))
)
```

### Tidy data

From "R for data science":

> In a tidy dataset,
>
> 1. each variable must have its own column.
> 1. each observation must have its own row.
> 1. each value must have its own cell.

![Tidy data](img/tidy-1.png)

The next two sections show examples of datasets that violate these principles.

### The Anscombe dataset

This is a dataset where principal statistical summaries (means, standard deviations, intercept and slope after regression) are identical across four subgroups but the layout of the data differs vastly.

```{r include = FALSE}
# anscombe data
```
```{r 401-anscombe-data}
anscombe
anscombe %>%
  as_tibble()
```

Working with this data in original form is rather tedious.

```{r include = FALSE}
# Difficult to aggregate and visualize
```
```{r 401-difficult-to-aggregate-and-visualize}
anscombe %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  summarize_all(list(~ mean(.), ~ sd(.)))

lm(y1 ~ x1, anscombe)
lm(y2 ~ x2, anscombe)
lm(y3 ~ x3, anscombe)
lm(y4 ~ x4, anscombe)

try(
  ggplot(anscombe) + 
    ...
)
```

**Your turn**: Which principles of tidy data does the `anscombe` dataset violate?

Many operations become much more natural when the data is in longer form.

```{r include = FALSE}
# Easier to work with in longer form
```
```{r 401-easier-to-work-with-in-longer-form}
anscombe_longer <-
  anscombe %>%
  mutate(id = row_number()) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    -id,
    names_pattern = "(.)(.)",
    names_to = c(".value", "measurement")
  ) %>%
  arrange(measurement, id)

anscombe_longer %>%
  group_by(measurement) %>%
  summarize_at(vars(x, y), list(~ mean(.), ~sd(.))) %>%
  ungroup()

anscombe_longer %>%
  group_by(measurement) %>%
  summarize(model = list(lm(y ~ x, .))) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  pull()

anscombe_longer %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(vars(measurement))
```

### WHO data

The following example shows a case that violates the first two rules of tidy data: WHO data arranged for optimal use of screen space.
The column names define, in addition to the measurement type `new_sp`, `new_sn`, `new_ep` and `newrel`, the age and sex stratum of the corresponding measurements.
One single `pivot_longer()` call transforms the data into a longer-form version with four measurement columns and one row for each age/sex stratum.
The `names_pattern` is a regular expression that defines what part of the column name is stored where.
([Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) are a powerful tool for parsing text data, out of scope for this lecture but very much worth looking into.)
The `names_to` sequence defines, for each `()` group in `names_pattern`, if the data encoded in the column name is stored in a new column or if it is kept as column name.

```{r include = FALSE}
# WHO data
```
```{r 401-who-data}
who %>%
  view()

who_longer <-
  who %>%
  pivot_longer(
    -(country:year),
    names_pattern = "([a-z_]+)_(.)([0-9]+)",
    names_to = c(".value", "sex", "age")
  )

who_longer

who_longer %>%
  count(sex, age)
```

### Formatting tables for presentation

Wide tables make better use of screen or paper space, and should be used when presenting tables that summarize across multiple dimensions.
For this, `ftable()` is the better tool.

```{r include = FALSE}
# Formatting for presentation with ftable()
```
```{r 401-formatting-for-presentation-with-ftable}
table2 %>%
  xtabs(count ~ ., .) %>%
  ftable()
```

These can be converted to HTML for inclusion in reports, e.g. with `memisc::format_html()`.

```{r include = FALSE}
# Deciding what goes into the columns, what into the rows
```
```{r 401-deciding-what-goes-into-the-columns-what-into-the-rows, results="asis", eval=knitr::is_html_output()}
table2 %>%
  xtabs(count ~ ., .) %>%
  ftable(col.vars = c("year", "type")) %>% 
  memisc::format_html()
```

The [{gt} package](https://gt.rstudio.com/) is a modern approach to present tables for formatting.
