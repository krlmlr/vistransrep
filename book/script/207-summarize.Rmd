Often we want to draw just conclusions from larger datasets by gaining insight by using statistical (or other) methods for summarizing -- and thus drastically reducing -- the data:
How much time did all planes spend in the air?

```{r include = FALSE}
# summary functions
```
```{r 27-summary-functions}
flights %>%
  select(air_time) %>%
  mutate(total_air_time = sum(air_time, na.rm = TRUE))
```

The `mutate()` call adds a new variable with the same value across all rows.
To reduce the result to a single row, use `summarize()`:

```{r include = FALSE}
# condense to one row with summarize
```
```{r 27-condense-to-one-row-with-summarize}
flights %>%
  summarize(total_air_time = sum(air_time, na.rm = TRUE))
```

The following functions compute summary values:

- `sum()`, `prod()`
    - `na.rm = TRUE`
- `mean()`, `median()`
- `sd()`, `IQR()`, `mad()`
- `min()`, `quantile(0.75)`, `max()`
- `sum()` and `mean()` for `logical` variables:
    ```r
    mean(is.na(arr_time))
    ```

- Ranking
    - `n()`
    - `first()`, `last()`, `nth()`


Simple counts can be computed with `n()` inside `summarize()`:

```{r include = FALSE}
# summarize with counts
```
```{r 27-summarize-with-counts}
flights %>%
  summarize(n = n())
```

A variety of aggregate functions is supported:

```{r include = FALSE}
# summarize with median
```
```{r 27-summarize-with-median}
flights %>%
  summarize(median = median(air_time, na.rm = TRUE))
```

It's possible to produce two different summarizations at once:

```{r include = FALSE}
# compute multiple summaries
```
```{r 27-compute-multiple-summaries}
flights %>%
  summarize(
    n = n(),
    mean_air_time = mean(air_time, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_air_time = median(air_time, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
```

The `summarize()` verb gains its full power in grouped operations.
Surround with `group_by()` and `ungroup()` to compute summaries in groups defined by common values in one or more columns.
In the next example, the same summary is computed separately for each origin airport.

```{r group-by-pic, fig.cap="Â© Allison Horst", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/group_by_ungroup.png")
```

```{r include = FALSE}
# Use group_by() and ungroup() to split data into groups
# ALWAYS use ungroup()
```
```{r 27-use-group-by-and-ungroup-to-split-data-into-groups}
flights %>%
  group_by(origin) %>%
  summarize(
    n = n(),
    mean_air_time = mean(air_time, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_air_time = median(air_time, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
```

Conceptually this corresponds to the following sequence of operations:

1. **Split** the dataset into groups defined by the values of the `origin` column.
    Each group has the same value in `origin`.
2. **Apply** the same summary for each group.
    In this case, the size, mean air time, and median air time is computed
    across all flights for each group.
3. **Combine** the results into one data frame.
    The grouping variables and the results are bound together for further analysis.

More often than not, the question "how do I iterate over each group and do ..." can be reprased as "what summary value do I want to compute for each group".
Recognizing this takes a bit of practice but is worth the effort, because the analysis code becomes shorter and more robust and often runs faster.

Groups can be defined over multiple columns as well.
The next example splits the data into one group for each day.

```{r include = FALSE}
# Groups can be defined by more than one column
```
```{r 27-groups-can-be-defined-by-more-than-one-column}
flights %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  summarize(
    n = n(),
    mean_air_time = mean(air_time, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_air_time = median(air_time, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
```

For quick exploration, the names of the new columns can be omitted:

```{r include = FALSE}
# Anonymous summarize for a quick glance
# (column name is defined by the expression)
```
```{r 27-anonymous-summarize-for-a-quick-glance}
flights %>%
  group_by(year, month, day) %>%
  summarize(
    n(),
    mean(air_time, na.rm = TRUE),
    median(air_time, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
```

The `n()` function computes a simple count, and is one of the most frequently used summary functions.
The `count()` function provides a convenient alternative.

```{r include = FALSE}
# count() = group_by() + summarize() + ungroup()
```
```{r 27-fixme-introduce-count}
flights %>%
  count(year, month, day)
```
