Some `geom()`-functions do some transformations and calculations behind the scenes before the data are visualized.
One such function is `geom_smooth()` from the last section. 
Also `geom_bar()` does some transformations first.
It just needs a mapping for the x-axis.
Once that is done, the y-values displayed for each value of the x-variable are the numbers of of times that the x-value occurs in the dataset.
So basically the different values are counted.

```{r include = FALSE}
# geom_bar()
```
```{r 14-geom-bar}
ggplot(
  data = mpg,
  mapping = aes(x = class)
) +
  geom_bar()
```
