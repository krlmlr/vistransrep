## [Spreading and gathering](spread-gather.html)

1. Use `spread()` to convert `table2` to `table1`. What is the meaning of the `key` and `value` arguments?

    ```r
    table2 %>%
      spread(_____)
    ```

1. Use `gather()` to convert `table1` to `table2`. Try an inclusive and an exclusive selection. Do you need an extra transformation to make the result fully identical? Can you reuse `key` and `value` from the previous result?

    ```r
    table1 %>%
      gather(_____, ___:___)

    table1 %>%
      gather(_____, -___:-___)
    ```

1. Visualize the data: plot cases, population, and both. Which of `table1` or `table2` is more suitable in which case?

    ```r
    ___ %>%
      ggplot(aes(___)) +
      geom_col()

    ___ %>%
      ggplot(aes(___)) +
      geom_col() +
      facet_grid(___ ~ ___, scales = "free")

    ___ %>%
      ggplot(aes(___, ___)) +
      geom_point()
    ```

1. Use `gather()` to convert `table4a` and `table4b` to `table2`. Can you do the same with just one `gather()` call?

    Hint: Use `bind_rows()` to combine similar tibbles.

    ```r
    cases_tbl <-
      table4a %>%
      gather(_____) %>%
      mutate(type = "cases")

    population_tbl <-
      table4a %>%
      gather(_____) %>%
      mutate(___)
      
    bind_rows(_____) %>%
      _____ %>%
      _____
    ```

1. Create a scatterplot from the `mpg` dataset that shows both highway and city fuel economy against engine displacement with two different colors using only one `geom_point()` call.

    ```r
    mpg %>%
      _____ %>%
      ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = ___)) +
      geom_point()
    ```

## [Separating and uniting](sep-unite.html)

1. Convert `table3` to `table1` and `table2`.

    ```r
    table3 %>%
      separate(
        ___,
        into = c("___", "___"),
        convert = TRUE
      ) %>%
      _____ %>%
      _____
    ```

1. Convert `table2` to `table3`.

    ```r
    table2 %>%
      _____ %>%
      unite(
        ___,
        ___, ___,
        sep = "/"
      )
    ```

1. Count the flights for each relation in the `flights` dataset, using just one grouping variable.

    ```r
    flights %>%
      unite(
        relation,
        ___, ___,
        sep = " -> "
      ) %>%
      count(___)
    ```

1. Find more exercises in Section 12.4.3 of r4ds.


## [Keys and mutating joins](joins.html)

1. How are the `flights`, `carriers`, and `airports` datasets connected? Which are primary, which are foreign keys?

    Hint: Use `count()` to support your hypothesis.

1. Plot a heat map of destination by airline for all flights shorter than 300 miles. Use explicit names for the carriers and the destinations. Does the result change if you use a full join? Do you use `geom_raster()` or `geom_bin2d()`?

    Hint: Use `by = c("dest" = "faa")`.

1. Find more exercises in Section 13.4.6 of r4ds.


## Filtering joins

1. Find the airports that are serviced by at least one flight. Which airports did not have direct connections in 2013?

1. Find more exercises in Section 13.5.1 of r4ds.
