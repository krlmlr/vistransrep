## [Spreading and gathering](spread-gather.html)

1. Use `spread()` to convert `table2` to `table1`. What is the meaning of the `key` and `value` arguments?

1. Use `gather()` to convert `table1` to `table2`. Do you need an extra transformation to make the result fully identical? Can you reuse `key` and `value` from the previous result?

1. Use a bar chart to visualise the data. Which of `table1` or `table2` is more suitable for plotting?

1. Use `gather()` to convert `table4a` and `table4b` to `table2`.

    Hint: Use `bind_rows()` to combine similar tibbles.

1. Create a scatterplot from the `mpg` dataset that shows both highway and city fuel economy against engine displacement with two different colors using only one `geom_point()` call.

1. Find more exercises in Section 12.3.3 of r4ds.


## [Separating and uniting](sep-unite.html)

1. Convert `table3` to `table1` and `table2`.

1. Convert `table2` to `table3`.

1. Use `separate()` to compute departure and arrival hours and minutes in the `flights` dataset.

1. Find more exercises in Section 12.4.3 of r4ds.


## [Keys and mutating joins](joins.html)

1. Do you see a problem in the `presidential` dataset? Can you see how does this affect the following bar plot without actually running the code?

    ```
    presidential %>%
      mutate(term = end - start) %>%
      ggplot() +
      geom_bar(aes(name, term))
    ```

1. How are the `flights`, `carriers`, and `airports` datasets connected? Which are primary, which are foreign keys?

    Hint: Use `count()` to support your hypothesis.

1. Plot a heat map of destination by airline for all flights shorter than 300 miles. Use explicit names for the carriers and the destinations. Does the result change if you use a full join? Do you use `geom_raster()` or `geom_bin2d()`?

    Hint: Use `by = c("dest" = "faa")`.

1. Find more exercises in Section 13.4.6 of r4ds.


## Filtering joins

1. Find the airports that are serviced by at least one flight. Which airports did not have direct connections in 2013?

1. Find more exercises in Section 13.5.1 of r4ds.
