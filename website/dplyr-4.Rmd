## [Grouped mutate](window.html)

1. Which month is busiest in terms of miles flown, over all carriers?

    ```r
    flights %>%
      group_by(___) %>%
      mutate(total_distance = sum(___)) %>%
      mutate(month_share = ___ / ___) %>% 
      arrange(desc(month_share)) %>%
      slice(1)
    ```

1. Visualize with a bar chart.

1. Which month is busiest in terms of miles flown, per carrier?

    Hint: Compute the share of yearly miles flown of each airline in each month.

    ```r
    flights %>%
      group_by(___, ___) %>%
      summarize(total_distance_by_carrier = sum(distance)) %>%
      mutate(total_distance = sum(___)) %>%
      ungroup() %>%
      mutate(month_share_by_carrier = ___ / ___) %>% 
      arrange(month_share_by_carrier) %>% 
      group_by(___) %>%
      slice(1)
    ```
    
1. Draw a heat map of miles flown per month per airline to see if this pattern holds across all airlines.

    ```r
    monthly_shares <-
      _____
    
    monthly_shares %>%
      ggplot(aes(factor(month), ___, fill = ___)) +
      geom_tile() +
      scale_fill_continuous(trans = "log10")
    ```
