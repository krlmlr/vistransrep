## [Scales](scales.html)

1. Choose one or two of your previous plots, and give the scales a proper name.

    Hint: Use one or more `scale_...()` functions.

1. What happens if you call the same `scale_...()` function twice in a plot?

1. Add an overview over all available colorblind friendly Brewer scales to your rmarkdown document.

    Hint: Insert a code chunk containing `RColorBrewer::display.brewer.all(colorblindFriendly = TRUE)`

1. Choose an appealing scale for one of your plots that use the "color" or "fill" aesthetics. Apply it with `scale_..._brewer("<name>", palette = "<palette>")`

    Hint: Use `scale_..._distiller()` if you have mapped a continuous variable.

1. Practice Markdown: Create sections, subsections, item lists, emphasized and bold text, ... .


## [Coordinate systems](coord.html)

1. Create a flipped boxplot of fuel economy by transmission type.

1. Plot highway vs. city fuel economy with an additional `geom_abline()` layer.  How do you set a 45° degree for the diagonal line? 

1. Try to "estimate" an approximate ratio between the two economy measures by tweaking the `slope` argument to `geom_abline()`.


## [Theming](theme.html)

1. Choose your favorite among the predefined themes.

    Hint: All start with `theme_...()`, but watch out for `theme_set()`.

1. Apply `theme(legend.position = "bottom")` to a plot with a color or fill legend.  What happens if you then apply `theme_bw()`? Why?
