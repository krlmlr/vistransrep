## Counting distinct observations

```{r joins-1}
airlines %>%
  count(carrier) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```

```{r joins-2}
airports %>%
  count(faa) %>%
  filter(n > 1)
```


## Destination by airline

```{r joins-3}
flights %>% 
  filter(distance < 300) %>%
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier") %>%
  left_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa"))
```

## Destination by airline, wide form

```{r joins-4}
flights %>% 
  filter(distance < 300) %>%
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier") %>%
  rename(carrier_name = name) %>%
  left_join(airports, by = c("dest" = "faa")) %>% 
  rename(airport_name = name) %>%
  count(carrier_name, airport_name) %>%
  spread(carrier_name, n)
```


## Destination by airline, economic join

```{r joins-5}
airline_names <-
  airlines %>%
  rename(carrier_name = name)

dest_airport_names <-
  airports %>%
  select(dest = faa, airport_name = name)

flights %>% 
  filter(distance < 300) %>%
  count(carrier, dest) %>% 
  left_join(airline_names, by = "carrier") %>%
  select(-carrier) %>% 
  left_join(dest_airport_names, by = "dest") %>% 
  select(-dest)
```
