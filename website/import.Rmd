## Import example file

1. Download the `.csv` files from https://github.com/krlmlr/vistransrep/tree/master/data. 

    Hint: Use the "Raw" button to get access to the raw data, then save the file to your local disk.

1. Use RStudio's import assistant (File → Import Dataset → From Text (readr)) to import the data with the likely most suitable settings. Copy the code that the import assistent generates to a script.

1. Import one of your own datasets with RStudio's import assistant (if possible) or with a helper package (example: the *pxR* package reads the PC-Axis format).

    ```r
    install.packages("pxR")
    library(pxR)
    ?read.px
    ```

1. Install the *rio* package, explore its capabilities.

    ```r
    install.packages("rio")
    library(rio)
    ?import
    ```

1. Try the *readit* package.
